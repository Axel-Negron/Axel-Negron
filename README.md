### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Axel Negron's Github
Welcome to my github page. I am a software engineer student from the university of Puerto Rico. I am passionate about programming and leaning more to the creative side of programming. I have always been a creative person who enjoyed art and when picking what field to major I decided on software engineering. I had always been amazed at what could be created in using programming and that passion and amazement drives me to learn more about various fields and merge them with programming.

## My Hobbies include...
- Music: I enjoy playing the piano and producing music from my computer. I also enjoy listening to artists especially r&b artists.
- Art: I love creating art using different mediums such as traditional paintings/drawings, digital art and 3D modelling and material creation using Blender.
- Reading: I also enjoy reading novels during my free time.
